# About
This repository contains parsing results of masked S-boxes in [NullFresh2](https://github.com/Chair-for-Security-Engineering/NullFresh2)<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> using the Verilog Parser of SILVER.

You can comment the code after `Parsing` in `Silver.cpp` and run `make`. Then you will get a executable binary file that only parses the design to get a `.nl` file.
